## 10-Minute Intro: From Sacred Boundaries to Digital Privacy

Purpose: Introduce how taboo boundaries map to modern privacy boundaries in a concise, accessible way.

Timing (10:00 total)
1) Hook & Definition (2:00)
- Prompt: “What do ancient Polynesian chiefs and your smartphone have in common?”
- Define taboo: cultural/religious boundaries around the sacred/dangerous; sanctions for violation.
- Transition: Today’s “sacred” = personal data and individual autonomy.

2) Core Parallel: Boundary Protection (3:00)
- Then: Taboo protected sacred knowledge, family secrets, social order.
- Now: Privacy protects personal information and digital identity.
- Key insight: Both create “untouchable” zones around what a society values.
- Illustrative contrast: Chiefs’ shadow (untouchable) ↔ biometric data (untouchable).

3) Violation & Consequences (2:30)
- Taboo violations: supernatural punishment (in some traditions), social ostracism.
- Privacy violations: identity theft, social shame, loss of trust, legal penalties.
- Shared anxiety: “contamination” that can’t be fully undone once boundaries are crossed.

4) Evolution of the Sacred (2:00)
- Shift: collective religious/cultural values → individual rights/autonomy.
- Continuity: need for protective boundaries around what we deem precious.
- Modern “pollution”: unauthorized data access, opaque algorithmic manipulation.

5) Wrap-Up (0:30)
- Privacy laws as modern taboo enforcement tools.
- Why breaches feel violating: boundary-crossing of what we now treat as sacred.

Optional 1-minute exit prompt (if time permits)
- “Name one piece of data you treat as ‘sacred’ and why.”

Suggested Readings (short, accessible)
- Wikipedia: “Taboo” (etymology: tapu/kapu).
- danah boyd, “Privacy and Publicity in the Context of Big Data” (blog, 2010).

## Mini-Lecture: Coding Is Political

Purpose: Make explicit how coding choices classify people and allocate power; tie back to taboo/status as data.

Timing (10:00–12:00)
1) Hook & Stakes (2:00)
- “An algorithm decides your feed, your matches, even aid eligibility—someone coded those rules.”
- Myth of neutral code: design choices encode values.

2) Taboo Status as Data (2:30)
- Traditional statuses (virgin/impure/initiated) as boolean-like variables controlling access.
- Modern parallels: relationship_status, credit_score, criminal_background.
- Example (Python):
```python
if ritually_pure:
    allow_temple_entry()
```

3) From Gossip to Algorithms (2:30)
- Then: community memory enforced boundaries.
- Now: code automates boundary enforcement (dating app “compatibility,” course “fairness”).
- These aren’t just technical decisions; they’re political choices about social organization.

4) Power to Classify (2:30)
- Without literacy: you are classified BY systems.
- With literacy: you help BUILD classification logic.
- Refine claim for precision: not “every line” is political, but key design choices about people encode values and have social consequences.

5) Your Political Choice (0:30–1:00)
- Coding = language of power in digital society.
- Prompt: “Do you want others making these choices, or to participate in making them?”

## Three-Part Mini-Lecture Series

Mini-Lecture 1: Boundaries, Taboos, and Privacy (10–12 minutes)
- Goal: Map taboo boundaries to digital privacy; establish vocabulary.
- Outcomes: Define taboo vs. privacy; identify boundary/violation parallels.
- Outline:
  - Hook: “What do chiefs and smartphones share?” → “sacred” boundaries.
  - Define taboo (sacred/forbidden/contaminating) with one concrete example.
  - Parallels to privacy (bank password, health status, browsing history).
  - Quick activity: list “off-limits” topics/data; which feel sensitive vs. sacred?
  - Transition: coding enforces boundaries automatically.
- Suggested Reading: Wikipedia “Taboo”; danah boyd (2010).

Mini-Lecture 2: Coding as Classification (10–12 minutes)
- Goal: Show translation of life into code categories (booleans, thresholds) and stakes.
- Outcomes: Recognize value-laden categories; critique assumptions in simple logic.
- Outline:
  - Hook: “If ritually_pure == True: allow_temple_entry()” → coding taboo logic.
  - Modern examples (pseudocode):
```python
if credit_score > 650 and income > 50000:
    approve_loan()
else:
    deny_loan()
```
  - Discuss: dating apps, dorm assignments, course registration as classification systems.
  - Key point: deciding which categories/thresholds matter is never neutral.
  - Activity: analyze 2–3 short pseudocode snippets; name assumptions/biases.
- Suggested Reading: Safiya Noble (Intro excerpt); Ruha Benjamin (“Default Discrimination”); Kirschenbaum (Chronicle, 2009).

Mini-Lecture 3: Agentic Coding—Power or Pseudo-Agency? (10–12 minutes)
- Goal: Probe promise/risks of AI-assisted coding without fatalism.
- Outcomes: Articulate benefits/risks; distinguish tool use from understanding.
- Outline:
  - Hook/demo: Ask AI for 10 lines of Python → “Do you understand each line?”
  - Promise: lowers barriers; enables action without full training.
  - Risks: black box, dependency, platform power concentration.
  - Nuance: with the right pedagogy, AI can scaffold—not supplant—critical thinking.
  - Discussion prompt: “Is this learning a language, or letting someone speak for you?”
- Suggested Reading: Ted Chiang (New Yorker, 2023); Nick Seaver (2017); short Zuboff excerpt.

## Teaching Strategy Across Weeks

Scaffold (2–3 weeks)
- Week 1 (Boundaries): Lecture 1 + activity mapping taboo vs. privacy in students’ lives.
- Week 2 (Classification): Lecture 2 + pseudocode analysis (pre-read Noble/Benjamin excerpt).
- Week 3 (Agency): Lecture 3 + live AI demo; reflection on empowerment vs. risk.

Assessment ideas (lightweight)
- Exit tickets (1–2 sentences): “Which category/threshold felt most political and why?”
- Reflection (200 words): “Where do you see ‘sacred’ data in your life?”
- Optional: Revise a snippet to reduce bias; explain your change in 2–3 bullets.

Notes for clarity
- Use “design choices encode values” rather than “every line of code is political.”
- Keep examples concrete, student-adjacent (feeds, matching, registration, housing).
- Distinguish “taboo” (sacred/forbidden/contaminating) from “sensitive” (contextual appropriateness).
