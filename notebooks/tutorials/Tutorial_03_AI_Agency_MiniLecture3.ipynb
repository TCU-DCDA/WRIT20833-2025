    "\n",
    "> 📺 **Connection to Previous Lesson:** This tutorial builds on [Mini-Lecture 3: Agentic Coding](../lecture-series/mini-lecture3/index.html) - exploring the difference between learning computational thinking and just outsourcing it to AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🔗 **Building on Previous Skills:** This tutorial assumes you've completed [Tutorial 1: Digital Boundaries](Tutorial_01_Digital_Boundaries_MiniLecture1.ipynb) and are comfortable with variables, string methods, and basic conditionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions/Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is designed for **Week 3** students and builds directly on concepts from Tutorial 1: Digital Boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Python Knowledge:\n",
    "**From Melanie Walsh Chapters 4-8:**\n",
    "- **Variables** (Chapter 4): Assignment, naming, re-assignment\n",
    "- **Data Types** (Chapter 5): Strings, integers, floats, booleans; `type()` function; f-strings\n",
    "- **String Methods** (Chapter 6): `.lower()`, `.upper()`, `.replace()`, `.split()`, indexing, slicing, `in` operator\n",
    "- **Comparisons & Conditionals** (Chapter 8): Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`); boolean operators (`and`, `or`, `not`); `if`/`elif`/`else` statements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Experience:\n",
    "- **Completed:** [Tutorial 1: Digital Boundaries](Tutorial_01_Digital_Boundaries_MiniLecture1.ipynb)\n",
    "- **Comfortable with:** Reading and writing basic conditional statements\n",
    "- **Familiar with:** Using string methods to analyze and manipulate text\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Tutorial Adds:\n",
    "- Critical evaluation of AI-generated code\n",
    "- Testing code for edge cases and limitations\n",
    "- Improving code through systematic analysis\n",
    "- Understanding the difference between using vs. understanding code\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You DON'T Need:\n",
    "- Functions (we'll analyze code without writing custom functions)\n",
    "- Lists and loops beyond basic `for` loops with strings\n",
    "- Advanced programming or AI/ML concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 60-75 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction: Language vs. Ventriloquism\n",
    "\n",
    "In Mini-Lecture 3, we asked: \"Are you learning to think computationally, or just outsourcing computational thinking?\" This tutorial will help you experience the difference between:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Learning a language** - Understanding what each piece does and why\n",
    "- **Letting someone speak for you** - Getting results without understanding the process\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Python concepts you've already learned (variables, data types, string methods, basic conditionals), we'll practice reading, testing, and improving AI-generated code."

    "## Prerequisites Check\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this tutorial, make sure you can confidently:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **String Operations:**\n",
    "- Use `.lower()` and `.upper()` to change text case\n",
    "- Use `in` to check if text contains certain words\n",
    "- Use string slicing like `text[0:5]` to get parts of text\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Conditionals:**\n",
    "- Write `if/elif/else` statements with proper indentation\n",
    "- Use comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`)\n",
    "- Combine conditions with `and` and `or`\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Variables and Data Types:**\n",
    "- Create and modify variables\n",
    "- Understand strings, integers, and booleans\n",
    "- Use f-strings like `f\"Hello {name}\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Self-Test:** If you completed Tutorial 1: Digital Boundaries and successfully created password checkers and data classifiers, you're ready for this tutorial!"
