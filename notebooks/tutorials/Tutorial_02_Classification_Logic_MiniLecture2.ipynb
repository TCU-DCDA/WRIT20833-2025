    "**WRIT 20833 - Mini-Lecture 2 Python Practice**\n",
    "\n",
    "> ðŸ“º **Connection to Previous Lesson:** This tutorial builds on [Mini-Lecture 2: Your Political Choice](https://tcu-dcda.github.io/curtrode.github.io/lecture-series/mini-lecture2/index.html#slide8) - if you haven't seen it yet, check out how the discussion of coding as classification leads to questions of agency and power.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions/Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial focuses on **basic classification logic** using individual examples and simple conditionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Python Knowledge:\n",
    "**From Melanie Walsh Chapters 4-8:**\n",
    "- **Variables** (Chapter 4): Creating and assigning variables to represent data\n",
    "- **Data Types** (Chapter 5): Working with strings, integers, booleans; understanding `True`/`False`\n",
    "- **Comparisons & Conditionals** (Chapter 8): \n",
    "  - Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`\n",
    "  - Boolean logic: `and`, `or`, `not`\n",
    "  - Basic conditional statements: `if`/`elif`/`else` with proper indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Practice:\n",
    "- Writing simple comparison operations that classify individual cases\n",
    "- Using basic conditional logic to make decisions\n",
    "- Analyzing how code embeds social values through individual examples\n",
    "- Connecting programming concepts to broader questions of justice and agency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplified Approach:\n",
    "- **Individual examples** instead of loops through multiple cases\n",
    "- **Basic if/else logic** without complex nested conditions\n",
    "- **Step-by-step analysis** of one situation at a time\n",
    "- **Change variables and re-run** to test different scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You DON'T Need:\n",
    "- Lists, loops, or functions (covered in later chapters)\n",
    "- Complex data structures or advanced programming concepts\n",
    "- Multiple examples processed simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 45-60 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pedagogical Focus:** This tutorial emphasizes **critical thinking about classification** using the simplest possible Python tools, making the social and political implications clear without overwhelming technical complexity.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Introduction: The Logic of the Sacred\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous discussions, we explored how ancient taboo systems created boundaries around the sacredâ€”determining who could enter temples, touch certain objects, or participate in rituals. Today, we'll see how this same boundary-making logic operates in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this ancient logic:\n",
    "```\n",
    "IF person is ritually pure\n",
    "THEN allow temple entry\n",
    "ELSE deny access\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider this modern equivalent:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if credit_score >= 700:\n",
    "    approve_loan()\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    deny_loan()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Both systems:\n",
    "- Create **categories** that define people\n",
    "- Establish **thresholds** for access\n",
    "- Automate **boundary enforcement**\n",
    "- Embed **social values** in seemingly neutral rules\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference? Ancient boundary-making required human interpretation. Digital boundary-making runs automatically, at scale, often invisibly."
